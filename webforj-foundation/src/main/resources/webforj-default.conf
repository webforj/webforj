# This configuration file is in HOCON format:

# Define the application’s entry point by specifying the fully qualified name of
# the class that extends `webforJ.App`. If no entry point is defined, webforJ will
# automatically scan the classpath for classes that extend `webforJ.App`. If multiple
# classes are found, an error will occur. When a package includes more than one potential entry point,
# setting this explicitly is required to prevent ambiguity, or alternatively, the `AppEntry` annotation can be
# used to specify the entry point at runtime.
webforj.entry = null

# Set to true to enable debug mode. In debug mode, webforJ will print additional information to the console and show
# all exceptions in the browser. Debug mode is disabled by default.
webforj.debug = null

# When enabled, the browser console will display highly detailed information about the entire client-server
# communication process. This setting is helpful for debugging interactions between the client and server
# but is not recommended for production, as it can slow down the application.
# The communication details are low-level and NOT intended for end-user comprehension.
webforj.showBrowserWarning = false

# When specified, the base path determines where DWC components are loaded from.
# By default, components are loaded from the server hosting the application.
# However, setting a custom base path allows components to be loaded from an alternate server or CDN.
# For example, to load components from jsdelivr.com, set the base path to:
# https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/webforj/dwc-dist@1.0.0-${webforj.version}#
#
# It’s important that the loaded components are compatible with the version of the webforJ
# framework in use; otherwise, the application may not function as expected.
webforj.components = null

# Define the locale for the application. The locale determines the language and region settings used by the application.
# Locale is used to determine the language of the application, as well as the format of dates, times, and numbers.
webforj.locale = null

# The string table is a map of key-value pairs that can be used to store strings for use in the application.
# https://javadoc.io/doc/com.webforj/webforj-foundation/latest/com/webforj/environment/StringTable.html
webforj.stringTable = {}

# The allowed file types for file uploads. By default, all file types are allowed.
# for instance:
#   image/*
#   application/pdf
#   text/plain
#   *.txt
webforj.fileUpload.accept = []

# The maximum file size allowed for file uploads, in bytes.
# By default, there is no limit on the file size.
webforj.fileUpload.maxSize = null
