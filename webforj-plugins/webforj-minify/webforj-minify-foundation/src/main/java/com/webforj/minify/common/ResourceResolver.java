/**
 * Resolves webforJ resource protocol URLs to filesystem paths.
 *
 * <p>Supports the following protocols:
 * <ul>
 * <li>webserver://path → src/main/resources/static/path</li>
 * <li>ws://path → src/main/resources/static/path</li>
 * <li>context://path → src/main/resources/path</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> URLs without a protocol (e.g., "app.css") are NOT supported because webforJ
 * passes them through unchanged to the browser, which resolves them as relative URLs. These
 * cannot be reliably mapped to filesystem paths for minification.
 *
 * <p><b>Security:</b> All resolved paths are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks.
 * Paths containing ".." that escape the resources root will throw {@link SecurityException}.
