# webforj-install-maven-plugin

A plug-in that automates installation of webforj project in the application server. 
The plugin executes during the ```mvn install``` step, and passes the JAR over HTTP(S) to a servlet running in the 
application server. The output of the servlet is displayed in the log, so the user can verify
the success of the installation steps. 

## Configuration

The following snippet shows a typical configuration in a webforj project. Include this in the 
```<plugins>``` section of your webforj project:

```xml
<plugins>
  <plugin>
    <groupId>com.webforj</groupId>
    <artifactId>webforj-install-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${webforj.version}</version>
    <executions>
      <execution>
        <goals>
          <goal>install</goal>
        </goals>
      </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
      <deployurl>http://localhost:8888/webforj-install</deployurl>
      <classname>samples.HelloWorldApp</classname>
      <publishname>hello-world</publishname>
      <debug>true</debug>
    </configuration>
  </plugin>
</plugins>
```

The ```<configuration>``` supports the following entries:
